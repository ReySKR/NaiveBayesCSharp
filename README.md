# Whats this?

This was one of my first steps into the topic of machine learning. What you see here is a Implementation of Naive Bayes in C#. It's not well optimized since this was one of my first "bigger" projects, but still I'm pretty proud of it for being the project that brought me into ML and then into the whole field of Data Science.

This can be used for a basic sentiment prediction of phrases based on a dataset.

I coded this back then for my last presentation in order to get the Abitur (general qualification for university entrance in Germany)

# Dataset
This contains the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/rt-polaritydata.README.1.0.txt">polarity dataset</a> v1.0 from <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/">Moview Review Data</a> originally created by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee.

Hint: Today (around 3 years later) I'm not sure how good this was implemented so take this with a grain of salt. But besides that, have fun with it! ;)
